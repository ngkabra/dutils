__This is not intended to be production ready yet__

This package contains a fabfile.py and other utilities that are useful
for deploying and testing a django based project on WebFaction servers.
With a little work they can be modified for use with any shared
hosting provider.

See comments in fabfile.py on what you need to do to use this.

Note: this package must live in your <django-project> directory.
